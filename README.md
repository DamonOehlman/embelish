# embelish

Embelish is a simple utility to add various embelishments to your projects README (or other markdown files).

## Features

### Auto insertion of project badges

Let's face it, badges are the hotness.  Adding them to your readme though is a pain.  May as well let a tool do that for you instead.  Embelish can add (and update) various relevant project badges to your `README.md` file.  The insertion position is after the first paragraph after the first `H1` defined in your markdown file (and right before the next heading).
